            Hey folks! I'm Vhalirie May Obligado, 20 years old, and I live in Ichon, 
        Macrohon, So. Leyte. I'm currently taking a BS in Nursing at The College of Maasin, and 
        I'm now in my second year. Yeeees!! 3rd yr. na gajud sunod buwan hehe. Thanks, G! I'm the type of girl 
        who prefers to stay at home watching movies, listening to music, and doing house chores rather than
        being outside and socializing. I only have a few friends, and they're all the best!! Okay, TMI.
        Proceed to the next group member.

            Hi, I'm Cristen Joy Ilan. My hometown is the Municipality of Saint Bernard, 
        but right now, I live in Brgy. Tagnipa, Maasin City, for the reason that 
        I'm currently studying at the College of Maasin, taking a Bachelor of Science 
        in Nursing. I'm looking forward to what more the nursing field brings into my
